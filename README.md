Festival Greetings Web Application

Project Overview

The Festival Greetings Web Application is a simple, interactive project that allows users to send festival greetings via email. The application features a visually appealing interface with falling flower animations and customizable messages for different festivals. Users can select a festival, input an email address, and send festive greetings directly to their loved ones.

Features

Festival Selection: Users can choose from a dropdown list of popular festivals.

Custom Greetings: Each festival has a unique greeting message that is sent to the recipient.

Email Integration: The app uses the mailto protocol to open the user's email client and pre-fill the subject and body.

API Integration (Optional): The application sends greetings via a backend API endpoint.

Falling Flower Animation: Adds a decorative and festive visual effect to enhance user experience.

Technologies Used

HTML5 – For structuring the webpage.

CSS3 – For styling and animations.

JavaScript – For dynamic functionality, handling email integration, and API calls.
